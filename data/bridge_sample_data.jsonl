Coconut haustorium, a spongy absorbent tissue formed from the distal portion of embryo during coconut germination, facilitates absorption of nutrients for the growing shoot and root.[72]", "Heart of palm is a vegetable harvested from the inner core and growing bud of certain palm trees (notably the coconut (Cocos nucifera), palmito juçara (Euterpe edulis), Açaí palm (Euterpe oleracea), sabal (Sabal spp.), pupunha and pejibaye (Bactris gasipaes) palms). Harvesting of many non-cultivated or wild single-stemmed palms results in palm tree death (e.g. Geonoma edulis).[1] However, other palm species are clonal or multi-stemmed plants (e.g. Prestoea acuminata, Euterpe oleracea) and moderate harvesting will not kill the entire clonal palm.

Consider the Fibonacci sequence modulo $m$. It still satisfies the recurrence $F_n\\equiv F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}\\pmod m$, and since there are only finitely many possible pairs $(F_{n-1},F_{n-2})$ it will repeat sooner or later. Because we also have $F_{n-2} \\equiv F_n - F_{n-1} \\pmod m$ we can run the recurrence backwards, so the repeating part of the sequence starts out right from $F_0$. Since $F_0=0$, there will be at least one $F_i\\equiv 0\\pmod m$ for each period of the repetition -- that is, infinitely many times.", "The general proof of this is that the fibonacci numbers arise from the expression $$F_n \\sqrt{-5} = (\\frac 12\\sqrt{-5}+\\frac 12\\sqrt{-1})^n - (\\frac 12\\sqrt{-5}-\\frac 12\\sqrt{-1})^n$$ Since this is an example of the general $a^n-b^n$, which $a^m-b^m$ divides, if $m \\mid n$, it follows that there is a unique number, generally coprime with the rest, for each number. Some of the smaller ones will be $1$. The exception is that if $f_n$ is this unique factor, such that $F_n = \\prod_{m \\mid n} f_n$, then $f_n$ and $f_{np^x}$ share a common divisor $p$, if $p$ divides either. So for example, $f_8=7$, and $f_{56}=7*14503$, share a common divisor of $7$. This means that modulo over $49$ must evidently work too. So $f_{12} = 6$, shares a common divisor with both $f_4=3$ and $f_3 = 4$, is unique in connecting to two different primes. Gauss's law of quadratic recriprocality applies to the fibonacci numbers, but it's a little more complex than for regular bases. Relative to the fibonacci series, reduce modulo 20, to 'upper' vs 'lower' and 'long' vs 'short'. For this section, 2 is as 7, and 5 as 1, modulo 20. Primes that reduce to 3, 7, 13 and 17 are 'upper' primes, which means that their period divides $p+1$. Primes ending in 1, 9, 11, 19 are lower primes, meaning that their periods divide $p-1$. The primes in 1, 9, 13, 17 are 'short', which means that the period divides the maximum allowed, an even number of times. For 3, 7, 11, 19, it divides the period an odd number of times. This means that all odd fibonacci numbers can be expressed as the sum of two squares, such as $233 = 8^2 + 13^2$, or generally $F_{2n+1} = F^2_n + F^2_{n+1}$ So a prime like $107$, which reduces to $7$, would have an indicated period dividing $108$ an odd number of times. Its actual period is $36$. A prime like $109$ divides $108$ an even number of times, so its period is a divisor of $54$. Its actual period is $27$. A prime like $113$ is indicated to be upper and short, which means that it divides $114$ an even number of times. It actually has a period of $19$. Artin's constant applies here as well. This means that these rules correctly find some 3/4 of all of the periods exactly. The next prime in this progression, $127$, actually has the indicated period for an upper long: 128. So does $131$ (lower long), $137$ (upper short, at 69). Likewise $101$ (lower short) and $103$ (upper long) show the maximum periods indicated. No prime under $20*120^4$ exists, where if $p$ divides some $F_n$, so does $p^2$. This does not preclude the existance of such a number.", "The trivial answer is: yes $F_0=0$ is a multiple of any prime (or indeed natural) number. But this can be extended to answer your real question: does this also happen (for given$~p$) for some $F_n$ with $n>0$. Indeed, the first coefficient (the one of $F_{n-2}$, which is $1$) of the Fibonacci recurrence is obviously invertible modulo any prime$~p$, which means the recurrence can be run backwards modulo$~p$: knowing the classes of $F_{n-1}$ and of $F_n$ one can recover the class of$~F_{n-2}$ uniquely. This means that on the set $\\Bbb F_p^2$ of pairs of classes of successive terms, the Fibonacci recurrence defines a bijection (a permutation of all pairs). Then since the set of pairs is finite, some power of this operation must be the identity on it. This implies that the case $F_n\\equiv0\\pmod p$ that happens for $n=0$ recurs for some $n>0$.", "Great question! First, let a prime $p \\mid a_n$. We can see that $a_0=2^{F_0}=2^0=1$ and thus $a_0$ is odd. Furthermore, $2^{F_n}$ is even for $n \\geqslant 1$, and thus $a_n$ is odd for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z_0}$ (non-negative integers). This means that $p$ is an odd prime. Now, observe the Fibonacci numbers modulo $m$. We have $F_0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{m}$, $F_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}$ and by the recursive formula for Fibonacci Numbers: $$F_{n+2} \\equiv F_{n+1}+F_n \\pmod{m}$$ where $n \\in \\mathbb{Z_0}$. It is easy to see by the Pigeonhole Principle that $(F_{n+1},F_n) \\bmod{m}$ must repeat. Then, we can retrace using $F_{n-1} \\equiv F_{n+1}-F_n \\pmod{m}$ to see that we have $F_x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{m}$ and $F_{x+1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}$ for some $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$. The smallest such $x$ becomes the period of $F \\bmod m$ and is known as the Pisano Period. We shall make use of the same in our proof. It is clear that $2^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ by Fermat's Little Theorem. Thus, we have: $$x \\equiv y \\pmod{p-1} \\implies 2^x \\equiv 2^y \\pmod{p}$$ Now, let $\\pi(p-1)$ be the Pisano Period of the Fibonacci Numbers modulo $p-1$. Consider $a_k$ for $p\\pi(p-1) \\mid k$. We have: $$a_k=\\sum_{i=0}^k 2^{F_i} = 2^{F_k}+\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 2^{F_i} = 2^{F_k}+\\frac{k}{\\pi(p-1)}\\sum_{i=0}^{\\pi(p-1)-1} 2^{F_i} \\equiv 2^{F_k} \\equiv 1\\pmod{p}$$ as $p \\mid \\frac{k}{\\pi(p-1)}$ and $F_k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p-1}$ since $\\pi(p-1) \\mid k$. Thus, we have: $$p\\pi(p-1) \\mid k \\implies a_k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$$ Now, assume that there are only finitely many possible prime divisors for $(a_n)$. Let the set of all such prime divisors be $S$. Simply consider: $$k=\\prod_{p \\in S} p\\pi(p-1) \\implies a_k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$$ for every $p \\in S$. This is clearly a contradiction as $a_k$ does not have any prime factor since none of the primes in $S$ divide $a_k$. Hence, the sequence $(a_n)$ must contain infinitely many prime factors, and we are done!", "For the first of your conjectures, which can be reformulated as '$p$ does not divide $F_p$' (see the comments by TheSimpliFire), the proof can be found on Wikipedia (in somewhat cryptic form). The wiki-page on Fibonacci primes states: A prime $p$ divides $F_{p-1}$ if and only if $p$ is congruent to ±1 modulo 5, and $p$ divides $F_{p+1}$ if and only if is congruent to ±2 modulo 5. (For $p = 5$, $F_5 = 5$ so $5$ divides $F_5$) Now suppose that $p \\neq 5$ and $p | F_p$. We will derive a contradiction. We know that either $p = \\pm 1 \\mod 5$ or $p = \\pm 2 \\mod 5$. We look at both cases separately. If $p = \\pm 1 \\mod 5$ then by Wikipedia $p|F_{p-1}$. Also, by assumption, $p|F_p$. It follows that $p|(F_{p-1} + F_p)$. In other words: $p|F_{p+1}$. But this means by Wikipedia that $p = \\pm 2 \\mod 5$, a contradiction. Similar, if $p = \\pm 2 \\mod 5$ we have that $p|F_{p+1}$ and $p|F_p$ so that $p|F_{p-1}$ which gives $p = \\pm 1 \\mod 5$, contradiction. I don't know how to do the other conjectures, though. $GCD(p, F_p) = 1$ gives $GCD(F_p, F_{F_p}) = 1$ but that gives no or very little information on $GCD(p, F_{F_p})$"]}

In any case, captains are expected to be exemplars of on field behaviour. The most recent regulations for UEFA are the Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship 2010-2012, and what applies to captains is: 14.04 Before each competition match, each team receives a match sheet on which the numbers, full names, dates of birth and, if applicable, the shirt names of the 18 players in the squad (23 players in the final tournament) must be entered, together with the full names of the officials seated on the substitutes’ bench and on the additional technical seats. The match sheet must be properly completed in block capitals and signed by the captain and the head of delegation. ... 16.04 If the taking of kicks from the penalty mark cannot be completed because of weather conditions or for other reasons beyond control, the results will be decided by the drawing of lots by the referee in the presence of the UEFA match delegate and the two team captains. ... 23.02 Protests concerning the state of the field of play must be submitted to the referee in writing by the relevant officials before the match. If the state of the field of play becomes questionable in the course of the match, the team captain must inform the referee, in the presence of the captain of the opposing team, orally without delay. In some national associations, if a player is cautioned or sent off and a suspension applies, the period of suspension is doubled if the player was captain at the time of the offence. Although I can't find a reliable reference for, I think that the doubling of the suspension time applies even if a player was acting captain at the time, receiving the armband after the regular captain went off field due to injury or substitution. At club level, captains have various roles that can range from traditional to official: They lead negotiations with club owners and managers regarding internal regulations, bonuses, etc, and in some associations such regulations are only valid if signed by all captains, They are generally expected to act as the public face of the players, it's not uncommon to see captains taking full responsibility after a loss, They are generally expected to act as mentors to younger players, especially players in youth and reserve teams.", "The captain and (during his absence on ice) alternate captains (not “assistant”) are players designated to be the point of contact between the referee and the team.

Also, this discussions relating to the interpretation of the rules cannot concern a penalty – no player, not even the captain, is allowed to make complaints regarding a penalty. When he makes such a complaint, he shall receive a minor penalty (a misconduct penalty under IIHF rules). The referee can (and often does) explain a penalty to the captains, but they are not allowed to complain. Note that the referee crease serves quite a different purpose: It is an area where officials can safely discuss among themselves – no player (not even captain) is allowed to enter the crease when the referee is reporting to or consulting with the other officials. Should he do so, he shall receive a misconduct penalty. But it is also the place where referees will usually discuss with the captains. Normally, there is one captain (marked with “C”) and two alternate captains (marked with “A”), one such player in each line. The NHL rules also allow to have no captain, but three alternate captains (this must be chosen prior to the game, and in this case, the Captain cannot be present in uniform). This is not possible in the international (IIHF) rules, where one captain and no more than two alternate captains must be appointed.

This effect applies to rubber bands too. Rubber has a highly coiled structure, which scatters light randomly, giving it a soft appearance. Image credits:Balloon science Upon stretching, the coils unwind and reflect more uniformly, which gives it a shiny look. This answer and this answer elaborates this effect well. So, on stretching a rubber band, it becomes more reflective, which means more light would reach your eyes, giving a perception of a lighter colour. Presence of surface impurities It may not be relevant, but the presence of surface impurities affects the colour change. In real life, rubber bands tend to gather dust and other contaminants over time. For ancient rubber bands (like the one I have) there is a complete layer of dark coloured impurities coated on its surface. Here are some close-ups. You can see that the surface impurities are more spread apart in the stretched band. Stretching the rubber band exposes the colour of 'fresh' rubber inside. This answer offers a good explanation. Here, I would like to emphasise the reason why I haven't considered the transparency effects. Transparency does not always imply 'lightness' A stretched rubber band is indeed more transparent than an unstretched one. But does that make the rubber band lighter? It does, only when you view it against a brighter background. As you can see, even in the dark background, the stretched rubber band is still lighter than the unstretched one. This shows that for my rubber band, the reflectivity effects are predominant over the transparency effects. This may not always be true and depends on various factors like the thickness of the band, type of rubber and pigment density. Transparency effects are much more noticeable in thinner objects, like rubber sheets. Interestingly, this effect can be exploited for making smart windows, that can precisely control the amount of light passing through it. Credits: MIT", "Anders Sandberg explained the main effect (in fact, decreased per-area pigment concentration and the band becoming thin are the same effect). There are two more effects that acts even for non-translucent rubbers, making them whiter: The presence of tiny cracks on the surface. When stretched, they open wider. One can see the same effect on macro scale in aged rubber. The cracks allow more light to scatter instead of going deep in the volume of the material and being absorbed (the same effect makes the snow white and the deep water black, blue or whatever less white). The presence of tiny voids in the bulk of the rubber, containing filler, pigment, air or just a discontinuity in the polymer. When subject to negative pressure, these also expand and scatter the light more than in non-stretched state.", "In general the rubber from elastic bands scatters light. This explains why rubbers are opaque, but still reflect light quite a lot, in the same way as milk looks white. In the presence of pigments, the whitening when pulled can be explained if the material scatters light more when it is stretched. More scattering means that light rays that get reflected, or scattered, at the surface of the rubber have to travel a smaller distance through the material before getting reflected. Hence, they have less chance to hit a color pigment. (Pigment density remains constant, as rubbers are fairly incompressible.) The remaining question is: Why is scattering larger when stretched? From this source: From these, it is concluded that: (a) Optical heterogeneities are present in stretched samples having a size of the order of several microns. (b) These heterogeneities are not present in the unstretched samples and develop with elongation in the same (or lower) elongation range where crystallization occurs. [...] (d) The heterogeneities primarily represent fluctuations in the orientation of anisotropic bodies rather than fluctuations in density. [...] Aaron was on the right track by mentioning scattering, but it seems that heterogeneities in the material are more relevant than crystallization to explain the whitening by light scattering."]}

The determinant was primarily introduced as a gauge to measure the existence of unique solutions to linear equations. It's like a litmus paper (which is used to know about acids and bases, but in this case its the existence of unique solutions). If you doubt that one can measure the uniqueness of solutions, I have a pair of magic spectacles you may keep that enable you to visualize the determinant in a new geometric way (this in fact can be found in many standard books, but I wanted to write the quintessence here). In response to your first question about origin, it dates back to the $3^{rd}$ century, when Chinese mathematicians used determinants in their book by name The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art (Chinese version and English version here ). At first, when the historians used the concept of determinants, they didn't refer to matrices but merely to the system of linear equations and treated the determinant as a property which tests for the existence of unique solutions for a system of linear equations. And later, due to the discovery of matrix theory, determinants have been moved to the theory of matrices (in a new manner of evolution). If you consider a matrix $$\\begin{pmatrix} a&b\\\\c&d \\end{pmatrix} $$ the determinant is given by $ad-bc$. You may wonder what information does $ad-bc$ may have within itself. All you need to do is to view things in geometric manner when you are unable to visualize things in algebraic way. Matrices are closely related to fields: in vectors and linear algebra, we representing vectors in terms of matrices. They can be seen as collections of vectors. The example that I have in mind is: consider a billiard table. Before hitting the balls, you take a thing which has a triangular frame and then arrange all the balls (present in an irregular manner) into a triangular shape. It's like arranging things in an organised manner, as human beings always try to do. Let me explain the topic in greater detail. If you look at the above figure, you can clearly see the coordinates. You can think of the columns of the matrix as vectors and the entities in the column representing their Cartesian placement (the coordinate positions). So now if you take all the above things into consideration, you can clearly see that if $ad-bc=0$ then the rhombus suddenly became a straight line, and in generalized manner a parallelopiped suffers a decrement in dimension by one (making the volume zero, which indirectly implies that it has an area). So analogously one can see that if the determinant becomes zero, according to the Cramer's rule, it makes the denominator go $\\infty$, which is a violation. Some of the important alternative notions about determinants: (stress on second one) Determinants in reality can be thought as a measure of multiplicative change in the volume of parallelopiped when it is subjected to linear transformation. It can be shown as : And the main notion that answers the connection between the determinant and existence of solutions is that the determinant of a matrix is zero if and only if the column vectors of the matrix are linearly dependent. Thus, determinants can be used to characterize linearly dependent vectors. For example, given two vectors $v_1, v_2$ in $R^3$, a third vector $v_3$ lies in the plane spanned by the former two vectors exactly if the determinant of the $3$-by-$3$ matrix consisting of the three vectors is zero. So one needs to take the theory of multilinear forms into consideration. I can't express the entire theory, but to give you a short notion, the determinant is actually a multi-linear form in general. So in a deep sense it measures the manifestations of the things related to vectors. And when determinants are negative, they have a role of orientation in geometric sense, which is another crucial point. Some Beautiful References : I have some suggestions for you. Apart from reading about matrix theory in Wikipedia page I suggest reading a very good article Making Determinants Less Weird by John Duggan. And I have come across another good article recently, which is here P.S : I took much time to edit and post this, so users are kindly requested to post any suggestions, in case of down-votes. Thank you.", "Historically the determinant was introduced by Gerolamo Cardano as an expression to determine if a linear $2\\times 2$ system has a solution. Later this was generalized by Leibniz for larger linear systems. You are right if you ask, why we use this particular notion in order to determine if a linear system has a solution or not. It is possible to define a different function that is zero if and only if the matrix induces a linear system that has a solution (say you can multiply the determinant with a scalar, or you take the absolute value). However, the determinant has other nice geometrically properties, which are helpful in many different applications. Here is just one example. A $n\\times n$ matrix $T$ decodes a linear transformation $t \\colon \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$. If you consider the volume of a $n$-simplex and its image in $t$, then the relative change of the simplex volume is $\\det(T)$. In particular, if $\\det(T)<0$ then the orientation of the simplex in the image is flipped. So it makes sense to define the determinant this way, because it comes in handy for many applications.", "The determinant was originally `discovered' by Cramer when solving systems of linear equations necessary to determine the coefficients of a polynomial curve passing through a given set of points. Cramer's rule, for giving the general solution of a system of linear equations, was a direct result of this. This appears in Gabriel Cramer, ``Introduction a l'analyse des lignes courbes algebriques,''(Introduction to the analysis of algebraic line curves), Geneve, Ches les Freres Cramer & Cl. Philibert, (1750). It is cited as a footnote on p. 60, which reads (from French): ``I think I have found [for solving these equations] a very simple and general rule, when the number of equations and unknowns do not pass the first degree [e.g. are linear]. One finds this in the Appendix No. 1.'' Appendix No. 1 appears on p. 657 of the same text. The text is available on line, for those who can read French. The history of the Determinant appears in Thomas Muir, ``The Theory of Determinants in the Historical Order of Development,'' Dover, NY, (1923). This is also available on line.", "I'm not sure I understand what you mean by how to \"derive\" this definition. Typically you simply define the determinant of a matrix this way and then show that it is useful because it has so many nice properties. Historically of course, this definition of the determinant was chosen because it had these nice properties, but these days you typically begin your discussion with the definition and then derive the properties. (The \"nice properties\" I am referring to here are things like the fact that a matrix is invertible iff its determinant is nonzero, etc.) Historically, the determinant was first used in a system of linear equations as a measure of whether a unique solution to the system existed. If the determinant of the system was nonzero, then there was a unique solution. When we started doing linear algebra with matrices, this naturally became the determinant of a matrix. Suppose though, that didn't have this definition already but that we wanted to find some function on a matrix that told us whether the matrix was invertible. It turns out that pretty much the only such function is the determinant function as defined in your question. In other words, there is a unique function, $| \\cdot |:M_n(\\mathbb{R}) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that is linear in the rows of the matrix, zero when the matrix is not invertible, and such that $| I_n | = 1$ (where $I_n$ is the identity matrix). The last condition we require as a normalization. This unique function is called the determinant function, and you can prove that its form is the one given above in terms of permutations. It turns out that this function also has all sorts of other uses, such as giving the volume of the parallelepiped created by the column vectors, etc. I must confess that I'm not exactly sure what you're looking for, so if this doesn't answer your question then feel free to comment and clarify."]}
